# blender-template-copier

a Windows batch script that creates a new Blender project based on a .blend template. When run, the script takes a specified .blend template file, copies it to a specified project folder, generates a unique name for the new project file, and then opens the new file in Blender. This allows users to start a new project without having to manually copy templates or worry about accidentally overwriting them.

edit the script and add the relevant paths so that the script knows where everything goes.

I Recommend renaming the script to the relevant file its opening. example : Sculpting_start.bat for the file that opens a new sculpting file.
